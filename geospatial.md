### [Mappy](https://github.com/mediasuitenz/mappy)
Mappy is a wrapper for Leaflet, which you essentially just give JSON config. It was useful in [Transport for Christchurch](https://github.com/mediasuitenz/transport-for-x) where due to restrictions on deployment environment, updating files isn't easy, but using mappy we could define the config in the CMS allowing us to change map styling etc without deployment.

Unfortunately it mostly just hides away Leaflet in a custom layer of obscure config, so unless you want a very simple map quickly, or are willing to update the mappy lib as needed, you're likely best with plain Leaflet or something else.
